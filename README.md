NOTE! Our signing key expired, so we had to move to a new one which will effectively shutdown existing ClickOnce installations!

For WP7.5 development on a pre-Win8 machine use the old standalone release, for those who have upgraded to Windows 8 and the Windows Phone 8 SDK please reinstall the current version to get the new cert. Sorry for the confusion.

 

The Windows Phone Power Tools are a natural extension to the developer tools that come with the Windows Phone SDK. Instead of allowing you to only install developer xaps the Power Tools let you test update scenarios by allowing you to update an existing developer app. Instead of having to step through the IsolatedStorage file browser on the command line, the Power Tools provide a GUI to allow you to interact with your applications.
